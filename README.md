# Overview
This repository contains Power BI projects that explore and visualize key trends in global demographics, economic growth, and health outcomes. These projects leverage datasets from various regions to analyze factors such as life expectancy, GDP, and population distribution over time. The insights derived aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how income levels, economic growth, and regional factors influence life expectancy and population dynamics.

# Projects Included
1. Global Life Expectancy and GDP Analysis (1900-2010)
Description: This project visualizes the correlation between life expectancy and GDP per capita across different regions from 1900 to 2010. It highlights the trends in economic growth and health outcomes, with a focus on the significant disparities between Europe, Asia, the Americas, and Africa.
Key Insights: Life expectancy has increased across all regions, with Europe consistently leading in both GDP and life expectancy. A strong positive correlation between GDP and life expectancy is observed globally.
2. Regional Population and Income Distribution
Description: This project explores the distribution of population and income levels across regions. It emphasizes how different income brackets affect regional demographics, with a specific focus on Europe, Asia, the Americas, and Africa.
Key Insights: Europe has the largest share of high-income earners, while Africa has the highest percentage of low-income earners. The project also demonstrates the significant impact of income on life expectancy, especially in the Americas.
